# master-of-reality-iso-66

Braindump for materials relating to the Master of Reality ISO 66-key (60%-style) keyboard.

Designed to use Matias (Alps-style) Quiet Linear switches

Poker-style case (for my build I am using the KBDfans.cn Tofu)

Currently experimenting with the QMK Proton-C and handwiring a matrix, although may change to a PCB design as the Tofu will require a base as well as a plate, so may as well use a PCB, as the case designed
